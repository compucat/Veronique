An emulator for Quinn Dunki's Veronica 6502 computer

Oh boy, here we go with another emulator! (If you don't know what I'm talking about, see my other repository "Rhombus".)
This is a project to emulate the Veronica 6502 computer hand-built by Quinn Dunki at her [blog] (http://quinndunki.com/blondihacks).

## CPU
This'll be easy-I'll just borrow the MIT-licensed [lib6502] (http://piumarta.com/software/lib6502/).

## Graphics
I'll use SDL 1.2 again, as I'm quite familiar with it. I'm not sure whether I'll try to make the backend compatible with my Rhombus backend or not. I probably won't-Rhombus is an entirely different beast.

## Sound
No worries here-Veronica doesn't have a sound card!

## Input
I'll have to eventually learn more SDL to support gamepads (two NES controllers on Veronica) and keyboard input.
